# Identities for demo application

Basic structure of data for demo application (app/demo_webcam.py).

Each identity must have a separate folder with images of the person. Folder should be named after the person (name of the person will be shown after identification)

**Note:** Images in this folder are from CelebA dataset - https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
